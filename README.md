Browser for interactive diagrams based on Draw.IO

## Idea

Just as wiki pages are automatically linked to each other when one page mentions another by name,
Plainion.DrawVista automatically creates links between diagrams when the name of one diagram
is mentioned within another.

This way related diagrams are easily connected and accessible, allowing convenient navigation
between different components and layers of your designs and architecture.
